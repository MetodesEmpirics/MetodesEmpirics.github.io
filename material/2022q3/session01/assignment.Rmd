# Instructions
Submit your answers to the six first exercises through Campus Global. The remainder of your assignments concern self-studies.

# Descriptive statistics
Imagine you measured the (average) voice pitch of 20 Korean (in Hz)^[This data was randomly sampled from the pre-processed and shortened version of the study of @winter+grawunder:2012, as provided in @aida. The data is accessible [here](https://rdrr.io/github/michael-franke/aida-package/man/data_polite.html).]. The data looks as follows: 

`208, 158, 153.3, 259.7, 102.9, 86.1, 231.9, 285.1, 181.2, 266, 252.5, 185.5, 110.7, 236.8, 207.5` 


Codified as a vector, called `pitch`, in R:
```{r, data}
pitch <- c(208, 158, 153.3, 259.7, 102.9,
           86.1, 231.9, 285.1, 181.2, 266,
           252.5, 185.5, 110.7, 236.8, 207.5)
```

Report the following summaries of this sample

  1. Mean
  2. Median
  3. Variance
  4. Standard deviation
  
Answer the following questions:
  
  5. Does the mean give a good summary of this sample? Why (not)?
  6. What is suggested by the mean and median leading to different summaries?
  7. Complete the following sentence with the first word that comes to your mind: *It's raining. I'm going to take the ...*
  
# Self-study 
1. Work through [Chapter 2 of Introduction to Data Analysis](https://michael-franke.github.io/intro-data-analysis/Chap-01-01-R.html) [@aida]: *Basics of R* (until the end of subsection 1.2);
2. Make sure you have a working R environment: either locally --on your computer-- or by having made sure you can execute code in a colab document
