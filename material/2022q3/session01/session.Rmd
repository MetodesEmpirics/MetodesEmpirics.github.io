# Overview

This class covers empirical methods for language sciences. The main goal is for you to understand and take control of the full cycle of (linguistic) analysis: planning; collection; processing; exploration; visualization; and analysis. By contrast to previous classes, you will also be introduced to *inferential* statistics. We follow a model-centric and computational approach.

## Analysis cycle

# Evaluation

### Weekly assignments (20%)
  * Submitted through Aula Global
  * Graded automatically
  * Max. 2 attempts
  * 6 in total

### Peer review (20%)
  * You give your peers (blind) feedback about their planned analysis
  * 1 in total

### Mid-term exam (20%)
  * Submitted through Aula Global
  * Graded automatically
  * Single attempt

### Analysis design and execution (40%)
  * A report of analysis designed and executed by yourself
  * If done in groups: A clear division of labor between members needs to be decided *and approved*
  * You will find an illustrative report and further guidelines in Aula Global
  * Evaluation criteria (100 points max)
    * Clarity: the analysis is clearly and succintly described; appropriate use of visual devices (30 points)
    * Replicability: the analysis plan covers all steps to allow for its replication (15 points)
    * Content: the analysis is well motivated and executed using the appropriate techniques (40 points)
    * Reproduceability: the analysis provides all the information necessary to reproduce it (15 points)
    * Creativity: The analysis goes above and beyond in one or multiple dimensions: e.g., visual devices; research question; methodology; documentation (20 points)

Failing the "analysis design and execution" the first time entails saving the remainder activities with a 40% of value on the final grade. The mid-term exam will be recovered through another exam. The re-sit of the "analysis design and execution" will also be an exam.


## Inferential statistics

Methods to not only describe or summarize the observed data (descriptive statistics) but to generalize to unobserved data and make predictions.

# Replicability and reproduceability
These terms are used differently --and sometimes interchangeably-- across the literature. However, they tend to check most of the same boxes. We follow the @national:2019 and define them as:

  * **Replicability**: obtaining consistent results using the same input data; computational steps, methods, and code; and conditions of analysis

  * **Reproduceability**: obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data
  
In all cases, documentation is key

# R 

We will use the [programming language R](https://www.r-project.org/). You do not need to have programmed neither in R nor any other language before. You also do not need to install R on your computer to follow the class: interactive notebooks have been set up so that everything can be executed on the cloud. That being said, I strongly recommend you to install R to get the most out of this class. Additionally, I also recommend installing [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/). This is a graphical interface that allows you to manipulate R code & data more easily. You don't strictly need it, but chances are it's going to make your quantitative life easier.

## Installing R and RStudio

The details of how to install R and RStudio depend on your operating system. [This Datacamp tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu) gives instructions on how to do so for Windows, Mac OS X, and Ubuntu.

## Test installation 
Make sure your installation was successful by running some R code. 

One way to do so is to copy/paste the following code into R studio (or from wherever you're running the code).

```{r}
print('Welcome to Empirical Methods 2')
#A demonstration of R code (to see that the code is running)
x <- 2 #this assigns the value '2' to variable 'x'
y <- 5 #this assigns the value '5' to variable 5
#Running this box of code will print the result of these operations:
x+y 
x*y
x**y
```

## Using R for data analysis
A good resource to get you started is Chapter 2 of @aida: [https://michael-franke.github.io/intro-data-analysis/Chap-01-01-R.html](https://michael-franke.github.io/intro-data-analysis/Chap-01-01-R.html)

# Descriptive statistics review

### Mean (finite case)
$$\Large \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i} x_i$$


### Median (finite case)
If the number of observations is even and ordered:
$$\Large median(X) = x_{\frac{n+1}{2}}$$

If odd and ordered:
$$\Large median(X) = \frac{x_{n/2} + x_{(n/2)+1}}{2}$$


### Variance & standard deviation


$$\Large \sigma_X = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$

If you need a refresher, Chapter 5 of @aida is a good reference: [https://michael-franke.github.io/intro-data-analysis/Chap-02-03-summary-statistics.html](https://michael-franke.github.io/intro-data-analysis/Chap-02-03-summary-statistics.html)
