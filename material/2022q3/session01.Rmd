# Introductory remarks

  * Website & material: [https://metodesempirics.github.io/](https://metodesempirics.github.io/)
  * Assignments due before DD, HH:MM


  For each session, you will find:

    * A rendered HTML file <img src="../fa/file-alt-regular.svg" width="22"/>
    * the Rmarkdown source <img src="../fa/markdown-brands.svg" width="35"/>
    * just the R code (without the text) <img src="../fa/r-project-brands.svg"  width="35"/>
    * data used for the session <img src="../fa/download.svg" width="30"/>


## Goals

  * Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
  * consectetur adipiscing elit
  * Vestibulum mattis ullamcorper placerat
  * Phasellus quis eros at turpis tempus

## R
We will use the [programming language R](https://www.r-project.org/). You do not need to have programmed neither in R nor any other language before. It is also not necessary to run R code on your machine. This class' code can all be executed online.

That being said, it is highly recommended to install R on your computer. This will give you less dependent on external resources; give you a better sense of how to build your own analysis; and make things run faster. If you do so, I also recommend installing [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/). This is a graphical interface that allows you to manipulate R code and data more easily. As you R itself, you don't strictly need it. Howevre, chances are it's going to make your quantitative life much easier.

  * To install R: follow instructions on [https://www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org)
  * To install RStudio: follow instructions on [https://rstudio.com/](https://rstudio.com/)
  * Alternatively: Follow the step-by-step instructions provided by [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu)

  * Executing and modifying R code
  * Replicability and reproduceability
  * The research cycle

# Descriptive statistics review

## Mean (finite case)
$$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i} x_i$$

```{r}
heights1 <- c(170,178,162,166,183,185) #a vector of heights in cms

mean(heights)
```


## Median (finite case)
If the number of elements in $n$ is even:
$$median(X) = x_{\frac{n+1}{2}}$$

If odd:
$$median(X) = \frac{x_{n/2} + x_{(n/2)+1}}{2}$$

```{r}
sort(heights) #not necessary to compute median, just for illustration
median(heights)

sort(heights2) #not necessary to compute median, just for illustration
median(heights2)
```

## More examples

```{r}

heights3 <- c(170,178,162,166,183,185,188,300) #a vector of heights in cms
mean(heights3)
median(heights3)
```

```{r}
#Let's automatize and let the computer create some data for us

#We will simulate reaction times (in milliseconds)
#Starting small, generating just 10 observations and telling R that the central tendency is 150 ms, with 20 ms of standard deviation

sim_reaction_times <- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 150, sd = 20) #sample 1000 times from a Normal distribution with mean 150 and sd of 20
print(sim_reaction_times) #look at what reaction times we sampled
plot(sim_reaction_times) #visualize the reaction times we sampled

mean(sim_reaction_times) #calculate their mean
median(sim_reaction_times) #calculate their median


#The same thing, but now with more observations sampled

sim_reaction_times <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 150, sd = 20) #sample 1000 times from a Normal distribution with mean 150 and sd of 20
print(sim_reaction_times) #look at what reaction times we sampled
plot(sim_reaction_times) #visualize the reaction times we sampled

mean(sim_reaction_times) #calculate their mean
median(sim_reaction_times) #calculate their median

plot(density(sim_reaction_times))

#Changing the generating distribution
sim_reaction_times_g <- rgamma(n = 1000, shape=1, scale=150) #sample 1000 times from a Gamma distribution with mean 150 and sd of 20

plot(sim_reaction_times_g)

mean(sim_reaction_times_g)
median(sim_reaction_times_g)

plot(density(sim_reaction_times_g))
```


## Variance & standard deviation


$$\sigma_X = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$

```{r}
heights
var(heights)
sd(heights) #the same as sqrt(var(heights))

#Unpacking variance and standard deviation
x_bar <- mean(heights) #this is the mean of the heights
print(x_bar)

dev_heights <- heights - x_bar #deviations of each height from the mean
print(dev_heights)

squared_dev_heights <- devs_heights**2 #squared deviations from the mean
print(squared_dev_heights)

sum_squared_dev_heights <- sum(squared_dev_heights) #sum of the squared deviations
print(sum_squared_dev_heights)

var_heights <- ( 1 / (length(heights)-1) ) * sum_squared_dev_heights #divide by number of observations - 1
print(var_heights)

print(sqrt(var_heights)) #square root of the variance = std
```
