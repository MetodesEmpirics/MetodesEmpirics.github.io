# Instructions

Submit your answers to the 6 first exercises through Aula Global (quiz section). Upload the remaining exercise concerning peer review through Aula Global as well (upload task).

# Regression

Consider the model `pitch ~ 1 + gender`, fit on the data from Franke & Roettger [-@franke+roettger:2019].

```{r}
df <- read.csv("https://tinyurl.com/polite-data") #download data

model <- lm(formula = pitch ~ 1 + gender, #fit model
            data = df)

#N.B.: this is equivalent to:
#model <- lm (df$pitch ~ 1 + df$gender)
```

  1. Is this model equivalent to `pitch ~ gender`?
  2. Is this model equivalent to `pitch ~ gender + context`?
  3. Is this model equivalent to `pitch ~ 1 + gender + context`?
  4. Is `pitch` the outcome, a predictor, or neither?
  5. Is `gender` the outcome, a predictor, or neither?
  6. What is the estimated effect on `pitch` of being a `male` speaker?
  7. What is the predicted `pitch` of a `female` speaker?

# Peer review (part I) 

Submit answers to these questions concerning your analysis report as a single page PDF-file through Aula Global. This submission makes up 10% of your peer-review grade. Remember that **your submission must be anonymous**. That is: do not put any information that can identify you in the PDF (like your name).

1. Your general research question

2. Why do you think this question is interesting? What does an answer to it  tell us?

3. Your specific research question

4. What kind of data would you use to address Question 2 if you had unlimited resources?

5. What kind of data are you planning to use to address Question 2 within the scope of this class?
    * How will you obtain it? 
    * How much will you collect? 
    * Do you think that is enough data to address Question 2? Why (not)?
  
Elaborate with as much detail as you (currently) have but it is perfectly acceptable if you answer in bullet points and single sentences. A randomly selected peer will give you feedback on them
