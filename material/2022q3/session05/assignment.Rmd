# Instructions

Submit your answers to the 4 first exercises through Aula Global (quiz section). Upload the remaining exercise concerning peer review through Aula Global as well (upload task).

# Regression

Consider the linear model `pitch ~ 1 + gender + context`, fit on the data from Franke & Roettger [-@franke+roettger:2019].

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
df <- read_csv("https://tinyurl.com/polite-data") #download data
```

  1. What is the estimated effect on `pitch` in a polite context for a female speaker?
  2. What is the estimated effect on `pitch` in a impolite context for a male speaker?
  3. How many parameters does this model have?
  4. Is a male speaker in a polite context predicted to have a higher pitch than a female speaker in an informal context?

# Self study

Use your time to work on your final report. Make sure you have all its details worked out by the end of the course.
