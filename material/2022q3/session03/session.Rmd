# What's in an analysis plan
For a detailed breakdown see this [OSF pre-registration template](https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/epgjd/) [@osf-prereg]

For a concrete example see [Replication of Experiment 1 of “The Adams family”](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie-esslli-2019-course-material/site/script/materials/prereg_report_Adams.pdf) by Michael Franke

### Research question(s)
Consider formulating your questions at different degrees of granularity. You may be curious about how phenomenon X works, in general, but your analysis may ultimately only address how some aspect of X, let's call it Y, works. It is crucial to always keep in mind how Y and X relate (i.e., what you can[not] learn from your study of Y about X).

An analysis can address questions but it can also generate questions. Often, the latter is called  *exploratory* analysis; and the former is called *confirmatory*.

### Design plan
A description of the overall design of your analysis. Among others, specify its type: What will you measure under which (varying?) circumstances? 

### Sampling plan
How, and how many, observations will you collect? And why?

### Variables
Give details for all variables that you will use in your analysis plan 

### Analysis plan
Describe how you will analyze the data

***

# Data
  * **Empirical** data comes in two main guises: **observational** --gathered with no intervention (i.e., by observation)-- and **experimental** --gathered through an intervention (i.e., an experiment).
  * **Virtual** data is synthetic in nature. It can stem from simulations or model predictions, among others.

## Variables
They are what you are measuring, i.e., an attribute of interest in your analysis (height; pitch; weight; gender; and so on).  Common types of variables are: 
  
  * **nominal variables**: unordered descriptions 
  * **ordinal variables**: ordered descriptions
  * **binary variables**: two mutually exclusive outcomes (nominal variables)
  * **metric variable**:  description that allows for quantitative comparisons 

## Basic design vocabulary
What matters is what is in your analysis plan, irrespective of how you call it. But it helps to be familiar with the basic vocabulary used to talk about experimental design.

  * **Sample size** describes how many observations go into your analysis
  * A **factor** is a discrete independent variable
  * A **n $\times  m$ factorial design** has two factors: one with $n$ levels (e.g., for $n = 2$: *informal* and *polite*) and the other with $m$ levels (e.g., for $m = 3$: *US*; *UK*; *India*). There are $n \times m$ experimental conditions in such a design.
  * There are three common types of **trials**
    * **critical trials** measure (one of) the conditions we care about
    * **control trials** are checks that will not go into the analysis but allow for quality control (e.g., if a subject is paying attention)
    * **filler trials** pad the critical trials to avoid repeated exposure to the critical trials to influence the experiment (e.g., subjects getting bored; figuring out what the experiment is about; and so on)

# Data formatting
Following Wickham -@wickham:2014, a tidy representation of data is one where:
  
  * each variable forms a column;
  * each observation forms a row;
  * each type of observational unit forms a table.
