## Generalized linear models

Recall our formulation of a linear model:

$$\Large y_i \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_i,\sigma)$$
$$\Large \mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta x_i$$

Notice that there is no constraint on the outcome of the operations on the right hand side. This was not an issue in the cases we saw so far, because $\mu_i$ could, in principle, be 5; 50; 600; 234.5 or 234.5634233. However, not all parameters and outcomes can take just any value. 

If we are predicting how likely an event is to occur, the outcome is between $0$ and $1$. It doesn't make sense to predict that the event will occur with a probability of $24.54$ or with a probability of $-1$. Similarly, if we are predicting how many times an event occurred, the rate of occurrence is $0$ or higher. It doesn't make sense to predict the event is expected to occur at a rate of $-5$. The kind of constraint we need on the right-hand side thus depends on the distribution we're taking as a starting point (what the parameter on the left represents). 

A *generalized* linear model is a model that takes the values on the right and applies a transformation to them to fulfill such a constraint. So far, we didn't have to apply any constraints because $y$ was distributed following a Normal distribution. But now we also want to make predictions about Bernoulli distributed and Poisson distributed outcomes. Recall that they look like this:

$$\Large y_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i)$$
$$\Large y_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_i)$$
For count data (Poisson distributed), the canonical function that constraints the estimates to suit the distribution is the exponential function.

$$\Large y_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i)$$
$$\Large \lambda_i = \text{exp}(\beta_0 + \beta x_i)$$
For probabilities (Bernoulli distributed), the canonical function that constraints the estimates to suit the distribution is the so-called inverse logit function.

$$\Large y_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_i)$$
$$\Large p_i = \frac{\text{exp}(\beta_0 + \beta x_i)}{1 + \text{exp}(\beta_0 + \beta x_i)}$$

In this session, we will look at count data, using a Generalized Linear Model and the Poisson distribution

#### Case study: Gestures 

Let's use the study of @brown+etal:toappear to exemplify a regression for count data. 


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
### Packages we will use ###
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
### ### ###

df <- read.csv('https://tinyurl.com/gestures-data') #download data
glimpse(df) #get a look at the data
```

We focus on the number of `gestures` (outcome / $y$), with `language`, `gender` and `context` as possible predictors.

Let's again first visualize the data to get a sense whether it even makes sense to predict number of gestures with any of these predictors:

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = gestures, fill = context)) +
         geom_histogram(bins=20, alpha=0.6, position='identity') +
         theme_minimal(base_size=20)

```


And the same for language:

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = gestures, fill = language)) +
         geom_histogram(bins=50, alpha=0.6, position='identity') +
         theme_minimal(base_size=20) 
```

And gender:

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = gestures, fill = gender)) +
         geom_histogram(bins=50, alpha=0.6, position='identity') +
         theme_minimal(base_size=20) 
```

Let's first build each model individually

```{r}
#Notice that we're now using a function called glm()
#Notice that we now specify the family of the model (Poisson)
#Notice that we now specify the link function (log)

gestures_context <- glm(formula = gestures ~ 1 + context,
                       data    = df,
                       family  = poisson(link = 'log')
                        )
summary(gestures_context)
```

Interpreting the coefficient is a little more difficult now. Before we could just read off the intercept's and predictor's contributions, but now everything happens in the *log*-space. The predicted number of gestures of a speaker in a professional context is:

$$\Large \text{log}(\lambda_i) \approx 3.99 - 0.178 \approx 3.812 $$
For an informal context, the prediction is accordingly just $3.99$. 

However, this is $\text{log}(\lambda_i)$ and not $\lambda_i$. So this is the logarithm of the expected number of gestures in both contexts. To get a non-logarithmic (and easier to interpret) prediction, take the inverse of the logarithm: the exponent.

```{r}
exp(3.99 - 0.178) #expected number of gestures in a polite context
exp(3.99)         #expected number of gestures in an informal context
```

Keeping this in mind, we fit the remaining two univariate models:

```{r}
gestures_lang <- glm(formula = gestures ~ 1 + language,
                       data    = df,
                       family  = poisson(link = 'log')
                        )

summary(gestures_lang)

gestures_context <- glm(formula = gestures ~ 1 + gender,
                       data    = df,
                       family  = poisson(link = 'log')
                        )
summary(gestures_context)
```

In words, being a speaker of Korean suggests less gestures than being a speaker of Catalan. But gender (alone) seems to be a bad predictor of number of gestures. 

Let's look at a model with all three predictors

```{r}
gestures_all <- glm(formula = gestures ~ 1 + context + language + gender,
                       data    = df,
                       family  = poisson(link = 'log')
                        )
summary(gestures_all)
```

# Goodness of fit: Information criteria

The AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) estimates out-of-sample prediction error. It provides a relative measure of model quality, penalizing for for model complexity. Lower is better.
