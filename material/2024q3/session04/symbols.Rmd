# Regression 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#this function fits a linear regression with "y" as outcome,
#"x" as predictor, and takes the information on x and y from
#the data frame df

lm(formula = y ~ x, 
   data = df) 

#This is the same as
lm(df$y ~ df$x)
```

For example,
```{r}
df <- read.csv("https://tinyurl.com/polite-data") #download data
model <- lm(formula = pitch ~ 1 + context, #fit model
            data = df)
```  

Fits a linear regression model with `pitch` as the outcome and `context` as a predictor. 

In formulae:

$$\large \text{pitch}_i \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_i,\sigma)$$
$$\large \mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{context}$$
