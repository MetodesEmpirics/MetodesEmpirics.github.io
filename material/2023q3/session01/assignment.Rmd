# Instructions
Submit your answers to the seven first exercises through Aula Global. Remember to round longer decimals to the second place after the comma. The remainder of the assignment concern self-studies.

# Descriptive statistics
Imagine you measured the (average) voice pitch of 15 Korean speakers (in Hz)^[This data was randomly sampled from the pre-processed and shortened version of the study of @winter+grawunder:2012, as provided in @aida. The data is accessible [here](https://rdrr.io/github/michael-franke/aida-package/man/data_polite.html).]. The data looks as follows: 

`208, 158, 153.3, 259.7, 102.9, 86.1, 231.9, 285.1, 181.2, 266, 252.5, 185.5, 110.7, 236.8, 207.5` 


Codified as a vector, called `pitch`, in R:
```{r, data}
pitch <- c(208, 158, 153.3, 259.7, 102.9,
           86.1, 231.9, 285.1, 181.2, 266,
           252.5, 185.5, 110.7, 236.8, 207.5)
```

Report the following summaries of this sample

  1. Mean
  2. Median
  3. Variance
  4. Standard deviation
  
Answer the following questions:
  
  5. Does the mean give a good summary of this sample? Why (not)?
  6. What is suggested by the mean and median leading to different summaries?
  7. Complete the following sentence with the first word that comes to your mind: *It's raining. I'm going to take the ...*
  
# Self-study 
1. Work through Chapter 1, Chapter 2 (until the end of subsection 2.2) and Chapter 3 of [Introduction to Data Analysis](https://michael-franke.github.io/intro-data-analysis/) [@aida];
2. Make sure you have a working R environment: either locally --on your computer-- or by having made sure you can execute code in a "colab" document
3. Look at the guidelines for the analysis report and read the illustrative report. Think of a general question about language that interests you and write it down.
